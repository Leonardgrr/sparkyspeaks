##A smile goes a long way 
---------------------------------

Make brushing your dogs teeth a daily routine. Be consistent and your tooth brushing experience will be great!!!

If your dog isn’t accustomed to tooth brushing don’t worry, start out by rubbing your dogs gums with your index finger. This will make your dog get used to his or her gums being massaged.

Gradually introduce the toothbrush with toothpaste for dogs; these are specially made with flavors that a dog can’t resist. Use a toothpaste that appeals to your dog, put a small amount on the toothbrush and start by brushing the back teeth then work your way up to the front teeth. Use a back and forth motion to brush the teeth.

Do not use toothpaste formulated for humans as it can cause an upset stomach in animals.

##Oral Disease
---------------------------------

>Oral disease is the most common health problem for pets. By the age of three, approximately 80 % of dogs and 75 % of cats have developed periodontal disease.

If the teeth have a lot of tartar on them or the gums are swollen or bleed easily then this should be brought to the attention of your vet. Left untreated, the infection can lead to tooth decay or tooth loss and can even spread through the bloodstream and cause kidney, liver, lungs and heart problems.

By preventing oral disease, you can help your pet live a healthier, happier life. Do not feed your pet table scraps, this can increase the formation of plaque and tartar. Dry, crunchy pet food can help clean plaque from the teeth.

##Common signs of Oral Disease
